## (Note this is broken) Using localWiFi network?

I tried to include a firmware version to let you plug in your ssid and password inside the firmware. The folder '2.54Ghz' under dev attempted to provide this firmware. Note to use it you must have a 2.54 Ghz router or some dual swapping enabled or you won't be able to use it. Unfortunatelty I dont have this available to me for testing so I wasn't able to dev this feature.

Whats needed to make this script work? The other firmare that works and acts as a wifi host had some ADS1299 timing logic that this is missing
